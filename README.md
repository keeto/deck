Deck JS
=======

Deck is a simple yet powerful JSGI layer that enables you to create cross-implementation server-side JavaScript fast and easily.

> *Note*: Deck is a work-in-progress at this point. The repository is public and you can play with it if you like, but it's not for public consumption at the moment.
